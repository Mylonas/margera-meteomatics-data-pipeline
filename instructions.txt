Background
For this exercise, we will use the https://www.meteomatics.com/en/weather-api/API, which is an open API that provides weather forecasting information. Look at the endpoints location search for locations and location day for forecasts for a particular day for that location.

Task
- Create a program using your preferred language/tool to get the forecasts for any 3 locations and for a period of 7 days.
- Store the data in a relational database of your choosing (MySQL, MS SQL, SQLite, etc.) with the appropriate schema.
- Create an API that uses the database data and provides endpoints for the following:
- List locations
  - List the latest forecast for each location for every day
  - List the average the_temp of the last 3 forecasts for each location for every day
  - Get the top n locations based on each available metric where n is a parameter given to the API call.

Deliverables
- A zip/tar.gz file containing the full source code and any other resources including CSV exports of your tables and SQL queries.
- Ideally deploy the solution to a cloud service (AWS, GCP, etc.)
- Instructions for running the application and installing any dependencies
- A short report (a few sentences is fine) outlining:
  - What overall process you went through in completing the task
  - Key decisions you made (if relevant). For example, known limitations.
  - What slowed you down, what was unexpected
  - Problems you ran into, and how you solved them
  - Tools and techniques you used
